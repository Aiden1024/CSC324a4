;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#|
(proof? prop proof) -> bool?
  prop: (and/or list? symbol?)
    A proposition that we wish to prove
  proof: list?
    A proof for that proposition

  Returns a boolean describing whether `proof` is a valid proof of `prop`
|#
(define (proof? prop proof)
  (equal? (proof/asmpt proof '()) ; check what proposition 'proof' proves
          prop))                  ; and check if it is equal to 'prop'

#|
(proof/asmpt proof asmpts) -> (and/or bool? list?)
  proof: list?
    A proof for that proposition
  asmpt: list?
    A list of currently valid assumptions

  Return either the proposition that a proof is proving given the assumption,
  or #f is the proof is invalid.
|#
(define/match (proof/asmpt proof asmpt)
  [((list 'use p) asmpt)
   (if (member p asmpt) p #f)]
  [((list 'assume hypo subproof) asmpt)
   (list hypo '-> (proof/asmpt subproof (cons hypo asmpt)))]
  [((list 'modus-ponens subpf1 subpf2) asmpt)
   (let* ([prop2 (proof/asmpt subpf2 asmpt)])
     (match prop2            ; "match" is like "case ... of" in Haskell

            conc

; Task 2: A Proof Checking Relation
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#|
(proofo prop proof)
  prop:  A proposition following the grammar specified in the handout
  proof: A proof following the grammar specified in the handout

  The relational form of the `proof?` function. Succeeds when "proof"
  is a correct proof of the proposition "prop".
|#
(define (proofo prop proof)
  (proof-helpero prop proof '()))

#|
(proof-helpero prop proof assmpts)
  prop:    A proposition following the grammar specified in the handout
  proof:   A proof following the grammar specified in the handout
  assmpts: A list of assumptions propositions

  The relational form of the `proof/asmpt` function. Succeeds when "proof"
  is a correct proof of the proposition "prop" given the list of
  assumptions "assmpts".
|#
(define (proof-helpero prop proof assmpts)
    (== #t #t) ; TODO REPLACE THIS!
)

#|
(membero x lst)
  x:   A value
  lst: A list

  The relational form of the `member` function. Succeeds when "x"
  is an element of the list "lst". You may use this relation as a helper
  in your implementation of "proof-helpero".
|#
(define (membero x lst)
  (fresh (first rest)
    (== lst (cons first rest))
    (conde ((== first x))
           ((=/= first x)
            (membero x rest)))))

(prove prop)
  prop:  A proposition following the grammar specified in the handout

  Returns a proof of the proposition, if a proof exists. Otherwise,
  this function returns `#f` or may fail to terminate.

  (void))
